# These are my dotfiles
run `sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fittiboy/personal-scripts/master/arch_setup)"` for the full setup.

Visit https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fittiboy/personal-scripts/master/arch_setup before running the script to check if you really want to run all commands present. The script is intended to get newly installed distros up and running in one command.

Also, it's mainly intended for ME personally. It sets up most of my ProtonMail, for example. You might want to uninstall ProtonMail Bridge for example and change/remove the mail-related configs and packages.
